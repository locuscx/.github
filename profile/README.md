# Locus

*A unified search and support network*

## About

Locus is an early-stage project designed to create an efficient search and support network focused on helping large teams find information or assistance quickly and securely. This is the public organization for the project.

## Public Repositories

The main company code remains private, but we maintain several public repositories including datasource implementations, client code, and other supporting tools. We keep these public because they aren't part of our core intellectual property. By sharing this code, we enable the community to:

- Understand how Locus works and integrates with various services
- Build adapters and connectors to bring their own services into the Locus network
- Contribute improvements and feedback

## Contributing

Interested in building an adapter for your service or contributing improvements? Check out our public repositories and feel free to submit issues and pull requests.
