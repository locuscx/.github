## About

Locus is an early-stage project designed to create an efficient search and support network focused on helping large teams find information or assistance quickly and securely. It is secure, self-deployed, and highly efficient at reducing human-time finding specific or proprietary answers.

## Plugin Development

Locus seeks to have compatability and efficiency in as many environments as possible. To encourage this, our plugin implementations for datasources, clients, and database connections are open-source. We encourage the development of community plugins and provide an SDK for our plugins. If you are interested in contributing, feel free to open a pull request on one of our official plugin repos to propose a new plugin or immprove an existing one.
